    "In the case of tracking a car's position, for example, if the vehicle is not doing any dynamic movements like turning - and is just traveling in a straight line a first order filter will probably out-perform a second-order filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The reason for this is**: \n",
    "- that a first-order system does not expect any changes in acceleration brought on by turns, so it functions directly as it is intended to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a second-order filter however, is expecting to see changes in acceleration, so it mistakes system and sensor noise as changes in acceleration and makes errors in estimating velocity which then affects position estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the vehicle starts turning then we assuime the second-order filter to outperform the first-order one, this is the main idea behind adaptive filtering."
